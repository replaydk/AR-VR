  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Dean Klakken III, a senior in this class, eager to explore the world of AR/VR and immersive media. My goal is to learn how to integrate these technologies into the game-making process.</p>
  <h2>Current Project: The Jungle Demo</h2>
  <p>I'm currently working on a project called <strong>The Jungle Demo</strong>, a first-person horror game set deep in a mysterious jungle. My focus is on creating an immersive and terrifying experience, and I'm excited to see how AR/VR can enhance the gameplay and atmosphere.</p>
