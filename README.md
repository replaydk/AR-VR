About Me

Hello! I'm Dean Klakken III, a senior in this class, eager to explore the world of AR/VR and immersive media. My goal is to learn how to integrate these technologies into the game-making process.
Current Project: The Jungle Demo

I'm currently working on a project called "The Jungle Demo," a first-person horror game set deep in a mysterious jungle. My focus is on creating an immersive and terrifying experience, and I'm excited to see how AR/VR can enhance the gameplay and atmosphere.

Feel free to connect or collaborate!
